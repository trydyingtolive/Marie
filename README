Marie is a lightweight WSGI micro-framework in Python for building dynamic websites in a very pain free way.
Marie was designed to:

    Be easy to use - Hello World in 5 lines, lots of goodies at your fingertips
    Be forgiving - Marie will even help you track down errors
    Be fast - Keeping you as close to bare metal speed as possible
    Give you the tools you need - Cookies, headers, forms, no problem
    Have authorized sessions - With Redis a high speed key value database
    Easily incorporate templates - With Mako a full featured templating language
    Be modifiable - Make it run the way you want

The 5 lines of Hello World
    import marie 
    def index(environ, name="World"):
        return "Hello %s" % name
    marie.expose('/', index)
    marie.run()

 In this example we have created a function and exposed it to the root ('/') URL. If you were to visit http://localhost/ you would see "Hello World" and if you were to visit http://localhost/Marie you would see "Hello Marie"

Installing Marie
Marie can be installed by using easy_install, pip or by simply using the marie.py file. There is also a windows binary file.
    ##EasyInstall
    easy_install marie
    ##Pip
    pip install marie

The story behind Marie
Some time ago while building a new dynamic website for a friend I was looking for a quick simple WSGI framework. At the time there weren't as many micro-frameworks, and the ones that did exist didn't match my needs. So I created Marie, and with each project I enhanced the code. Over time as I worked on more projects Marie began to become more usefull. Things that I kept doing over and over were added to the code and problems I kept running into were made easier to find. Other features to help move things along were also added. On April 26, 2011 Marie was released to the public in hopes that this framework will help others as much as it has helped me.
